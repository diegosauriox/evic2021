					<h3><p ALIGN="justify">
					The Latin American Summer School of Computational Intelligence (from its spanish acronym EVIC) is an annual event that has been held in Chile since 2004. Its objective is to promote Computational Intelligence, bringing together areas such as Intelligent Control, Robotics, Computer Vision, Computational Neuroscience, Science of Data, Pattern Recognition and Big Data among others. The event presents from the basic concepts to the latest research results in these areas. Its target audience is undergraduate and graduate students, university professors and professionals, from Chile and Latin American countries. EVIC is organized by the Chilean Chapter of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) and the host University. EVIC is an event that was born at the Universidad de Chile, but to achieve a greater scope and diversity of its attendees, since 2013 it has become itinerant, taking place in different universities in the country, such as the University of La Frontera (EVIC 2013), the University of Concepción (EVIC 2015), the University of Valparaíso (EVIC 2017), the University of Santiago (EVIC2018) and the Austral University (EVIC 2019). This year it virtually returns to Temuco.

				<h3><p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Title:</strong> Mining Social Networks to Learn about Rumors, Hate Speech, Bias and Polarization</p>
					<p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Resume:</strong> Online social networks are a rich resource of unedited user-generated multimedia content. Buried within their day-to-day chatter, we can find breaking news, opinions and valuable insight into human behaviour, including the articulation of emerging social movements. Nevertheless, in recent years social platforms have become fertile ground for diverse information disorders and hate speech expressions. This situation poses an important challenge to the extraction of useful and trustworthy information from social media. In this talk I provide an overview of existing work in the area of social media information credibility, starting with our research in 2011 on rumor propagation during the massive earthquake in Chile in 2010. I discuss, as well, the complex problem of automatic hate speech detection in online social networks. In particular, how our review of the existing literature in the area shows important experimental errors and dataset biases that produce an overestimation of current state-of-the-art techniques. Specifically, these issues become evident at the moment of attempting to apply these models to more diverse scenarios or to transfer this knowledge to languages other than English. As a particular way of dealing with the need to extract reliable information from online social media, I talk about two applications, Twically and Galean. These applications harvest collective signals created from social media text to provide a broad view of natural disasters and real-world news, respectively.</p>

				<h3><p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Title:</strong> Engineering System Design Using Natural Systems</p>
					<p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Resume:</strong>This talk will put forth several straightforward but successful implementations of analytical approaches inspired by
						 natural systems to difficult engineering system design problems.  These nature-based paradigms range in fidelity with their natural systems
						  origins but all seek to leverage the structures and operations of nature doing what it does best – novelty detection, system optimization,
						   adaptability to dynamic environments, robustness, and flexibility.  More specifically, the well-known, but often misunderstood and misused,
						    artificial intelligent paradigms of artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, and evolutionary algorithms will be considered for use in 
							engineering system design.  Used judiciously and knowledgeably these approaches can offer significant advantages in diverse production and 
							operational environments.  A curated selection of applications from the speaker’s more than 25 years of experience in this field will be
							 explained and objectively analyzed.  The applications are (1) quality and process improvement of large-scale ceramic casting, 
							 (2) real-time placement of drones for ad hoc communications network connectivity, and (3) continuous monitoring of airport vehicles for predictive maintenance.</p>

					<h3><p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Title:</strong> Analytics for Industrial AI: Leveraging Model Ensembles</p>
						<p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Resume:</strong> In the past, analytic model creation was an artisanal process, as models were handcrafted by experienced, knowledgeable model-builders. More recently, the use of meta-heuristics, such as evolutionary algorithms, has provided us with limited levels of automation in model building and model maintenance. Data-driven models are becoming a commodity, as we have access to a large number of data-driven models by a combination of crowdsourcing, cloud-based evolutionary algorithms, public-domain libraries, outsourcing, in-house development, and legacy models.  In this context, the critical issue will be model ensemble selection and fusion, rather than model generation.  First, we will illustrate the use of model ensembles within the context of assests Prognostics and Health Maintenance (PHM) of assets such as aircraft engines, medical imaging devices, and locomotives.  We will cover a few case studies of anomaly detection, diagnosis, prediction, and optimization. Then, we will describe the evolution of analytic models in the era of cloud computing, and propose the use of customized model ensembles on demand, inspired by Lazy Learning. This approach is agnostic with respect to the origin of the models, making it scalable and suitable for a variety of applications. We will present results on the fusion of data-driven models for FlyQuest, a GE-sponsored Kaggle competition, in which we crowdsourced the generation of models predicting the estimated runway and gateway arrival (ERA, EGA) over a month of US flights. We will also describe the fusion of hybrid ensembles, combining physics-based and data-driven models to leverage domain knowledge to improve the performance of analytics. Finally, we will highlight some research trends, challenges and opportunities for Machine Learning techniques in this dynamic context of big data and cloud computing. </p>

				<h3><p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Title:</strong> Multioutput Gaussian Processes</p>
					<p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Resume:</strong> This talk will focus on the multioutput extension of Gaussian processes (GP), referred to as Multioutput Gaussian processes (MOGP). Akin to their scalar-valued counterpart, MOGPs are Bayesian nonparametric generative models for time series, which, in addition to modelling temporal dependencies among data, also account for across-channel relationships. In this regard, the main challenge in MOGPs is the construction of covariance functions that are as capable as possible to identify relationships among different time series while fulfilling the structural properties (e.g., positive definiteness) of the full multioutput covariance. We will start with a motivation for MOGPs and they can be constructed by mixing independent GPs, then, we will revise standard approaches to covariance design and their implications. Lastly, we will present dedicated software for MOGPs with examples and real-world applications.</p>

					<p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Resume:</strong> Logmeter es un sistema automático que usa tecnología Laser Lidar para estimar el volumen y las variables biométricas de la madera apilada siendo transportada en camiones. Este sistema se basa en generación de nubes de puntos 3D y en algoritmos matemáticos avanzados para calcular el volumen. Luego, usando metodologías de Machine Learning se construyen modelos predictivos para estimar o predecir el volumen sólido de cada camión.
						Los modelos predictivos logran relacionar las variables biométricas estimadas automáticamente por el Logmeter con un volumen sólido utilizado como referencia. En el trabajo que se presentará aquí, el volumen sólido de referencia está estimado usando una metodología basada en las fórmulas de Arquímedes. Los resultados obtenidos hasta ahora muestran un sistema capaz de predecir el volumen sólido en forma automática con un intervalo de confianza cercano al +-10% (intervalo al 95%) a nivel de banco y +-7% a nivel de camión. Estos resultados muestran la precisión y exactitud del sistema Logmeter y reafirma su posición como estado del arte en medición automática de volumen sólido de madera.
						La evolución del sistema Logmeter considera la utilización de visión artificial en tiempo real con el objetivo de realizar un conteo de la carga durante el paso del camión para condiciones lumínicas y ambientales de una faena forestal. Para esto, se utilizó la red convolucional YOLO, capaz de segmentar múltiples objetos en imágenes. Adicionalmente, se trabajó en generar un sistema de iluminación y control de cámaras que permitiera el correcto funcionamiento durante las 24 horas del día. Luego de realizar un entrenamiento con múltiples condiciones lumínicas, ambientales y de carga del camión, se incorporó un sistema de selección de conteo para cada banco. La implementación actual logra contar los troncos totales con un error de 0.35% y de 2.38% en la evaluación por banco.
						En suma, en este tutorial se detallan dos aproximaciones de utilización de técnicas de Machine Learning que permiten estimar variables de faenas forestales en condiciones reales

						<p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Resume:</strong> Fish School Search (FSS), proposed by Bastos Filho and Lima Neto in 2008 is an optimization algorithm inspired on the collective behavior of fish schools. In the session we are going to learn the mechanisms of feeding and coordination movement that create the search operators, the core idea that makes the fishes “swim” toward the positive gradient in order to “eat” and “gain weight”. We will also learn how the collective behavior in which heavier fishes influence the search process as a whole, as well as what makes the barycenter of the fish school move toward better places in the search space over the iterations. Finally, the FSS main principles will be explained to the audience, namey: Simple computations in all individuals (i.e. fish) Various means of storing information (i.e. weights of fish and school barycenter), Local computations (i.e. swimming is composed of distinct components), Low communications between neighboring individuals (i.e. fish are to think local but also be socially aware), Minimum centralized control (mainly for self-controlling of the school radius), Some distinct diversity mechanisms (this to avoid undesirable flocking behavior), Scalability (in terms of complexity of the optimization/search tasks) and Autonomy (i.e. ability to self-control functioning).

				<h3><p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Title:</strong> Considerations on ethics in AI applications</p>
					<p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Resume:</strong> We are facing the digital transformation. The use of advanced systems using Artificial Intelligence (AI) has grown exponentially. The talk will address some considerations on ethical dilemmas in the use of AI and their implications, including personal data usage in social networks, autonomous cars, industrial automation, among others. Great challenges for AI systems include explainability and transparency in decision making by machine learning algorithms, e.g., in deep learning models. Another issue is identifying biases (in the data) and their mitigation, if not the elimination of such problems, which may lead to system unusability, e.g., by government and institutions.</p>
